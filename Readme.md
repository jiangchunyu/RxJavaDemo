# RxJavaDemo

This project is the demo for my [blog](http://blog.csdn.net/wl9739/article/details/52212275)ï¼Œdemostrating how to use **RxJava** to solve the multisources from network and local database.

I use the flowing librarys in this demo:

* RxJava
* Retrofit
* Realm

The api is from Gank.io, God bless them!
